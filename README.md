# Visualization of Stock using Dash

## Project Overview
This project uses **Dash**, a Python framework for building analytical web applications, to visualize stock market data in an interactive and intuitive way. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can analyze the trends of different stock symbols by selecting time periods, viewing stock prices, and observing other financial indicators.

The goal is to provide an interactive visualization that can be used by both traders and analysts to gain insights from stock data and make informed decisions. The project integrates real-time stock market data and historical performance analysis into a web app, ensuring that users can explore the data and visualize trends over time.

## Features
- **Interactive Stock Charts**: Visualize stock prices using **line charts**, **candlestick charts**, and **bar charts** for different stock symbols.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetch the most recent stock market data and display it interactively. Users can see updates as they explore different time ranges.
- **Customizable Date Range**: Users can choose specific date ranges (e.g., last week, last month, or a custom date range) to see how the stock prices performed over that period.
- **Stock Symbol Selector**: Easily switch between different stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) and explore their respective price trends.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Download**: Option to download the visualized data in CSV format for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Dash**: A Python framework for building web applications with rich interactive data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: A powerful graphing library used to create the interactive charts and plots in the app.
- **Pandas**: A Python data manipulation library for loading, cleaning, and transforming stock market data.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Data source used for fetching real-time and historical stock prices.
- **Plotly Express**: Used to simplify the creation of visualizations in Dash.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x or higher
- Git (if you plan to clone the repo)
- Basic knowledge of Dash and Plotly

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kritu1418/Visualization-of-stock-using-dash.git
Usage
Stock Symbol Selection:

The app features a dropdown list that allows users to select a stock symbol. Available options could include popular symbols such as AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, etc.

When a stock is selected, the app will update the visualization to display that particular stock's data.

Date Range Selection:

The user can choose between predefined time ranges such as:

Last 7 days

Last 30 days

Last 90 days

Custom date range (from a start date to an end date)

Once the date range is selected, the app will adjust the visualization to show stock price movements for the selected period.

Charts:

Line Charts: Display the stockâ€™s closing price over time.

Candlestick Charts: Show detailed stock price movements including open, close, high, and low values for each time period.

Bar Charts: Provide a visual representation of stock volume and price changes over time.

Data Export:

Users can download the displayed stock data as a CSV file for further offline analysis.
